  <p>She's walking. Downtown it's almost shoulder to shoulder. She's able to walk without interrupting anyone, but it's a take of 
    constant maintenance. Right to left across the sidewalk and back. Lawless.</p> 
  
  <p>She is walking to a payphone, with a coin in each shoe, jumping against her toes with every step. They turned out unnecessary
     -- what would be suspicious about carrying coins? It had been paranoid of her -- but she's reassured nonetheless. They are
    there, hidden and unknown, until she spends them.</p>
  
  <p>She's prepared with notes and a folderful of documentation in her purse, if necessary, but she is expecting to leave a 
    message for a machine. That's what she was told to expect: a live line, always unanswered, anonymous, perfect. She peeks 
    inside the folder briefly and almost collides with another pedestrian.</p>
  
  <p>For the past several months, since graduation, since her hire, she has been dropping anything that crosses her desk into a
    secret folder for leverage. Fresh out of college she took a job as a translator and personal assistant for a local coffee
    farm, and in the years intervening she has made sure that she, personally, is indispensible to the company.</p> 
  
  <p>Sophia reflects on her past months of work, almost two years now, for a man who is not from the republic, who could have 
    been born here if his parents weren't vacationing at the time. They bought the land decades ago, after the coup, and started
    the farm.</p> 
  
  <p>Four acres of coffee are certified organic. This is where their profits are made. The rest of the farm is uncertified and 
    they do sell both kinds legally, for the most part.</p> 
  
  <p>His parents had built a football field for children of their workers, but currently the football is makeshift. They built a 
    hospital, but it is not reliably staffed or stocked. At the moment, he is planning to expand the farm, adding luxury cash 
    crops, buying and demolishing houses, telecommuting to more meetings than not. She smiles.</p>
  
  <p>Many of the workers are seasonal, transient, or foreign immigrants like her. They have little ability to unionize, negotiate
    contracts, or choose a different path. On a global scale, the economy and the food production chain rely on these workers, 
    and they rely on keeping them exploited. She grits her teeth.</p>
  
  <p>Not today.</p> 
  
  <p>She watches a butterfly ascend the corridor between skyscrapers, upward forever, lazily toward the sun.</p>
