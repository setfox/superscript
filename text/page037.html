  <p>Let me tell you about the first time I heard a story told.</p>
  
  <p>I was very young at the time, and there was a large tent set up in the mountains. There was a small black platform at the
    center and a redhaired woman in a green skirt had come to speak to us in an accent I'd never heard in person. Her voice 
    was amplified and the crowd was large.</p>
  
  <p>I don't remember the story but I remember the event. The breeze was cool and we were surrounded by newly planted trees. It
    felt like the first time anyone had been outside in a long time, maybe the winter had been unusually harsh. There was a newly
    dug well and fresh water was like a novelty.</p>
  
  <p>There was something in the air. Even as a child I could feel the change coming. Like the planet itself was taking an active
    part in our evolution.</p> 
  
  <p>I don't remember the story but I remember the pastries my mother had made. You know the way a certain sensation can house
    an entire memory, vivid and unexpected? These cookies really take me right back to that time, when I was a child, hearing
    a story for the first time. In addition to the recipe I've attached a scent module containing a scientific approximation of 
    what they should smell like, if you follow the recipe correctly.</p>
  
  <p>These attachments are encrypted, and you should have received a copy of our proprietary decryption software when you met 
    with our technician for setup. If you have any issues decrypting the recipe or the scent module, please don't hesitate to 
    contact us. Additionally, we ask that you do not share this information with anyone! Not even your closest friends or
    government agents, ha ha. It is my family's secret recipe, passed down for generations, and it is only intended to be viewed 
    by my lovely subscribers ;)</p>
  
  <p>Thank you for joining our network. We hope you are pleased with our subscription services and you won't hesitate to reach 
    out to us if you have any questions, right?</p>

  <p>===DAY 0: ATTACHMENT 1===</p>
  
  <p>Forgive the charade. I'm afraid my name isn't Cleo but for the purposes of your training you can call me J.</p>
  
  <p>It is necessary to mask all of our communications. I hope you will respond in kind, and I urge you not to discuss or share 
    any contents of any attachments in any way whatsoever. I trust you understand the gravity of my concerns.</p>
  
  <p>I'm afraid many of our interactions will be more cryptic than this, and it may take some effort in order to decipher the 
    information I am trying to impart to you.</p>
  
  <p>The second attachment contains three manufacturing projects that can be assembled into a deadly weapon. This is as clear as
    I can be and this is the only time I will be so clear. You must figure out how to assemble it yourself, and I would advise 
    you to pursue training locally, unless you are experienced with safe and proper handling techniques and armed with conflict 
    de-escalation tactics.</p>
  
  <p>These projects should be used only once to avoid arousing suspicion, and they should be printed with a batch of at least
    a dozen other, unrelated projects. They are rights management secured, so the files will become unusuable after the first 
    print. This is industry standard. Do not try to copy them. Any serious manufacturing station will see through forgeries.</p>
  
  <p>You are free to browse our libraries and select red herring projects at your discretion. I would suggest baking and 
    culinary tools, since that was the theme of this message, but you are free to select any projects you'd like.</p>
  
  <p>You will need credentials in order to print. We have provided these for you, but in order to ensure that you are of 
    satisfactory caliber as an operative, the location of your badge has been hidden within the syntax of your attachment
    encryption key. Once located, these credentials will allow you to print under guise of employment. If anyone at your local
    manufacturing station asks questions that you are not prepared to answer, please let me know and I'll coach you for next
    time.</p> 
  
  <p>The software you used to access this message will also allow you to send encrypted replies, if needed. The output is 
    designed to resemble unremarkable images, so please attach them to a message that says something equally unremarkable, like 
    "Thought you might enjoy this." Most likely I will not reply, but I will address your concerns in the next "subscription" 
    attachment.</p>
  
  <p>I would urge you to cover any tracks that led you to our organization. If you have made any unsecured communications
    over the course of your journey towards us, please destroy those devices as well. Send me their IN#, encrypted, and I will 
    ensure an identical device is issued to you, able to pass the strictest inspections, if needed.</p>
  
  <p>Please destroy this message and the device you viewed it on as soon as you receive its replacement. You will not need such
    containment procedures in the future -- no other messages will be so explicit, and so it is up to you to decide whether 
    storing unauthorized data is a risk you can mitigate.</p>
