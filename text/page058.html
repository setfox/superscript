        <b>
  <p>There is a man named James and he is digging. He's been walking for days, prepared for the journey, wandering in circles,
    back and forth, digging approximately evenly spaced holes across the desert, using a shovel like a dowsing rod across 
    the barren landscape. Following instinct as a way to cope with the statistical, impossible scale of the task.</p>
  
  <p>He is looking for a box. Black cube, 18 inches across, sealed and waterproofed. He had been told about it long ago. He 
    had been told it should only be opened if the species is at risk of extinction. "You will know how to find it," his 
    grandfather had said.</p>
  
  <p>He drives the shovel into the salt, leans back, wipes sweat, and rations water. Across the horizon he can see his work,
    maybe four trenches per square mile, extending farther than the eye can see. A rabbit dashes through the brush in his
    peripheral vision.</p>
  
  <p>He resumes digging and thinks about his true name. He could tell the truth now, or what he remembers of it, if he ever
    encounters another living being.</p>
  
  <p>"I came here from another time. I chose this," his grandfather had said. He had disregarded this as the madness of age,
    but recently he is starting to wonder.</p>
  
  <p>The shovel hits resistance. A hollow thump, an unnaturally flat surface. Looking back later that night he cannot remember
    unearthing it: it's uncovered. He steps back.</p>
  
  <p>It's not a cube and it's not black. It is weatherproofed. It's oblong, maybe 18 inches tall but probably more, definitely
    at least three feet wide. It looks like it was brown or green and the weatherproofing is maybe green or brown.</p>
  
  <p>Is this it? This can't be it. He jams the shovel into the padlock, breaking through layers of wax or plastic or some 
    extremophilic material. The seam slices easily with the knife and the box is open.</p>
  
  <p>It's full of books. Weird books. Midcentury metaphysical fiction, or nonfiction, something in between self help and 
    spirituality. This can't be it. Is this it?</p>
  
  <p>James hops up out of the hole and takes a seat on the edge. The sun is going to set soon and he's not particularly interested
    in dragging the entire trunk back with him, but neither is he comfortable breaking the weatherproofing and then leaving it
    there to rot. Someone, for some reason, went to a lot of effort to bury this.</p>
  
  <p>He wonders if it's worth coming back tomorrow with the motorcycle, when it will rain next, whether and where he could 
    find gasoline. Unknown to him, miles away, at the same moment, Esther is siphoning the last of the nearest gas from a 
    station by the coast.</p>
  
  <p>He picks up a few books and upends them, rifling through the pages. No hidden compartments, no cash, no cryptic messages
    stowed in between, it seems.</p> 
  
  <p>He packs up a few of the better titles, jams a tall wiry branch into the soft ground to mark the location, and leaves.</p>
