  <p>There is a lampshade in Sophia's bedroom, a shadow, a representation of a higher dimensional object, made out of embezzled 
    and repurposed printer paper. There is a spider on the lampshade.</p>
  
  <p>Sophia watches it try to navigate a perimeter, and she watches it stop when it reaches the place where it began. She wonders
    if it recognized its surroundings or if she moved, and startled it.</p>
  
  <p>Moments earlier she had watched it rappel down to within inches of the surface of her bedsheets, and she had yelled at it
    halfheartedly, and it, violating all expectation, had politely retreated back to the lampshade to, she assumes, devise 
    another strategy.</p>
  
  <p>She had also moved the bedsheets to prevent it from hiding in a wrinkle. The top sheets were blue, the fitted sheets red. 
    She wonders whether it had turned back because she had yelled or because, it had seemed, the ground itself changed in ways
    impossible to understand. Can spiders see color?</p>
  
  <p>There is no part of the lampshade not overhanging her bed, and while she does expect the spider would eventually find the
    cable back to the ceiling, and perhaps even the window back outside, she doesn't particularly want it in the room while she
    sleeps.</p>
  
  <p>She stands up and the spider watches her, ready to run, who knows where. She has a clear glass of water and an empty opaque 
    mug on her nightstand. After a moment of deliberation she pours the water into the mug and tips the spider into the mostly
    dry vessel. The cut of the glass throws geometric shadows across the wall as it approaches the light, expanding and 
    contracting in side.</p>
  
  <p>Standing on the bed, she tips the glass into the windowsill and the spider is already gone.</p>
  
  <p>Drifting off to sleep, she muses on the interaction. It had not seemed like a spider. Or, more like, she sees spiders every
    day but this one was not the same. She can't quite put her finger on it.</p>
  
  <p>She wonders what she would do if she was a fly battering a windowpane. Would she be able to feel the breeze coming from 
    inches below? Would she be able to figure it out?</p>
  
  <p>Can a spider deduce a shape from walking on the surface of its shadow?</p>
  
  <p>Later that night Sophia will dream she is walking in an endless white landscape, carrying a tool and a weapon. She will see 
    a way out, the air itself splits apart, and she will dream a passageway to somewhere else. In the dream she will try to step 
    through this window in the air, but as she approaches it the ground beneath her feet loses integrity, splits into a thousand
    pieces, each slowly floating away. She retreats, and as she steps back the ground pieces itself together. She steps forward 
    and it diverges again.</p> 
  
  <p>She stands motionless, hoping for divine intervention. She looks back over her shoulder to see she is standing on the
  surface of her own hands. She wakes up.</p>
