  <p>"Aleph, please wake up." This one got through to her, for some reason, and her eyes fluttered.</p>
  
  <p>A beam of golden light is filtering down from a square on the ceiling. Ceta pours the tea. It's green, and thick, and 
    horrible. The smell alone rouses Aleph from the depths slightly.</p>
  
  <p>"What time is it?"</p>
  
  <p>"I have bad news for you, but drink this first." She sighs, resigned, and does. "Ask me what day it is," Ceta says.</p>
  
  <p>"Oh no," she replies.</p>
  
  <p>"What's the last thing you remember?"</p>
  
  <p>Aleph hesitates, confused from sleep and wary of the question. "We went to the sub-basement. There was a desk, locked, 
    with a crown inside, attached to a bundle of wires -- "</p>
  
  <p>"That's enough. That's good." He takes the empty cup from her. "Aleph, you've been asleep for two days." "But -- " "It's
    morning. You have time." She relaxes. "The good news is that you were responsive to stimuli, and your vitals were stable 
    throughout. There's no indication of brain damage."</p> 
  
  <p>"Brain damage?"</p> 
  
  <p>"If you had not woken up or if you had been unresponsive, there would be risk."</p>
  
  <p>Aleph purses her lips. "What's the bad news?" Ceta laughs lightly. "That was it, for the most part. Don't worry! You've 
    already figured out the rest, you've only got a few hours before testing, but everything seems to be fine. You should get a 
    physical exam for documentation's sake, but you were asleep for less than 50 hours, so unless there's something we don't 
    know, you should be fine."</p>
  
  <p>A seed, lighter than air, drifts through the light and catches in the ventilation system. "What, what is it?" Ceta 
    asks.</p>
  
  <p>"Are we in trouble?"</p>
  
  <p>Ceta laughs. "No. Well..." He trails off. "Can you walk?"</p>
  
  <p>Later, waiting at the medical clinic, in bits and pieces, she got the answer out of him. "We were proceeding ahead of 
    schedule, and the device you tested was experimental. I may have failed to run the experiment by the committee before we 
    performed it... The device is ancient, it had been in the quarantine library for centuries... I got you a work exclusion 
    from the gardens, your tomatoes are almost ripe, so we might have to explain ourselves at some point, but no, 'trouble' is 
    not the word I would use."</p>
  
  <p>"You know I'm going to put all this in my log." She raised an eyebrow at him.</p>
  
  <p>"Yes," he said. "That shouldn't be a problem. We haven't done anything wrong."</p>
  
  <p>"But," she said. He nodded, and they stared at the wall.</p>
  
  <p>The possibility of her death, and the consequences of her death, hung in the air.</p>
  
  <p>He lowered his voice. "Please be careful how you phrase it."</p>
  
  <p>This would become a minor detail in their story. Later that day, Aleph would take the test indicating tertiary competency
    with a specialization in botany, and later that evening, during a ceremony, her and her peers' test results and career 
    tracks would be announced. Aleph would become the first student in years to be selected for the inner circle, and for 
    a long time Aleph and Ceta would not see each other again, until they meet for the final time, at the door he had described 
    to her years ago.</p>
  
  <p>They see each other once more before she leaves, after the ceremony and after dinner. "I have something I need to tell you,"
    she says. "You go first," he counters.</p> 
  
  <p>She relates to him an experience she had during the test. Because of it she does not particularly believe or trust her test 
    results -- she had glanced at the wall and seen many walls, all at once, all in the same place. Each with a slight 
    mathematical variation in the printed detailing on the concrete. On instinct she had, perhaps, touched the wall with her
    mind, and in response each wall moved in relation to each other, but none moved in relation to their surroundings. She 
    looked up at the other students, each focused on their own test with a different, unique, personal caliber of concern.</p>
  
  <p>She looked at the many students within each student, each with a slight mathematical variation in detail. Like she could see
    many possible versions of each of them, extending as far as the eye could see, fading off to some horizon.</p>
  
  <p>"Did you try to touch them with your mind?" Ceta was leaning forward in his chair, eyes wide.</p>
  
  <p>"Ceta," she said. "It was a hallucination."</p>
  
  <p>"Well." He leans back. The corridor is empty. It's late at night, but sounds of activity echo past. Aleph's peers are 
    packing up as well, saying goodbye to friends and mentors, but they are each heading upstairs, and Aleph is alone in her 
    journey.</p>
  
  <p>"There's something I should tell you as well." For a long time he says nothing, and she is patient.</p>
  
  <p>"It's all a lie. Everything they had me tell you, about why we're here, what we're doing... There is no landing. We aren't
    on a terraforming mission. We aren't mining an asteroid, we aren't flying through space. We never left earth. The surface
    is toxic."</p>
  
  <p>Aleph does not respond.</p>
  
  <p>"They're not going to tell you this downstairs, I think. I figured it out for myself."</p>
  
  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>
  
  <p>Ceta gestures the unknowable.</p>
  
  <p>Aleph picks up a canvas bag, walks through the archway and down the stairs.</p>
