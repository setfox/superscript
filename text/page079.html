<p>"Ceta, how deep do the catacombs go?" He had been too young to be asking, at the time.</p>

<p>"Well, she lied, "Once upon a time a woman found the edge."</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"I think we're about to find out," she said, leading him through a doorway and down a staircase.</p>

<p>She led him to the edge of the compound, to the beginning of the construction, where the machines were carving out new caves.
"We can't get much closer than this. It's dangerous. But let me tell you a story."</p>

<p>They sat on a sort of cliff's edge, a temporary architectural feature, and watched the immense wheels turn, grinding out the
rock below. Each tooth of the wheel much larger than either of them.</p>

<p>One wheel would carve out a new edge, widening a hole already dug. Another machine followed it, finishing the edges, reprinting 
concrete filigree, intricate and geometric. Soon it would be a new hall, larger than the last.</p>

<p>"Once," she began, "Long ago, when I was only a few decades older than you are now, there was a woman who found the edge. She 
traveled much farther into the depths of the mines than we have now, and she found a door."</p>

<p>"What kind of door?"</p>

<p>"It was large, and metal, a rolling door, like the one next to the dining hall. But it was different. This door held an immense
wheel, a lock, holding it shut."</p>

<p>He was too young. It was too soon for this story to work its effect on him.</p>

<p>"When she found the door, she knew that she would die if she went through it, and not like our kind of death. The old kind. But 
she went through anyway. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>He looked at the machines, and back to her.</p>

<p>"There are some things our science cannot do," she said. "And there is one unforgivable sin."</p>

<p>"Anything can change, but no one can leave," he parroted, but surely he could not have had a thorough idea of what that slogan 
might mean.</p>

<p>They watched the machines churn.</p>
