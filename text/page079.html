<p>"Ceta, how deep do the catacombs go?" She had been too young to be asking, at the time. In all Ceta's years of mentoring,
  Aleph had consistently been one of his most challenging students.</p>

<p>"Well," he lied, "Once upon a time a boy found the edge."</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"I think we're about to find out," he said, leading her through a doorway and down a staircase.</p>

<p>He led her to the edge of the compound, to the beginning of the construction, where the machines were carving out new caves.
  "We can't get much closer than this. It's dangerous. But let me tell you a story."</p>

<p>They sat on a sort of cliff's edge, a temporary architectural feature, and watched the immense wheels turn, grinding out the
  rock below. Each tooth of the wheel much larger than either of them.</p>

<p>One wheel would carve out a new edge, widening a hole already dug. Another machine followed it, eating up the debris, 
  finishing the edges, reprinting concrete filigree, intricate and geometric. Soon it would be a new hall, larger than the 
  last.</p>

<p>"Once," he began, "Long ago, when I was only a few decades older than you are now, there was a young man who found the edge. 
  He traveled much farther into the depths of the mines than we have now, and he found a door."</p>

<p>"What kind of door?"</p>

<p>"It was large, and metal, like the one next to the dining hall. But it was different. This door held an immense wheel, a 
  lock, holding it shut."</p>

<p>She was too young. It was too soon for this story to work its effect on her.</p>

<p>"When he found the door, he knew that he would die if he went through it, and not like our kind of death. The old kind. 
  But he went through anyway. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>She looked at the machines, and back to him.</p>

<p>"There are some things our science cannot do," Ceta said. "And there is one unforgivable sin."</p>

<p>"Anything can change, but no one can leave," she parroted, but surely she could not have had a thorough idea of what that 
  slogan might mean. Not yet.</p>
      
<p>Ceta took a deep breath.</p>

<p>They watched the machines churn.</p>
