  <p>Just off the coast, on an island that didn't exist ten years ago, Esther is packing up. She's been hiding out here, it 
  seemed the safest place to be, but she's running low on food and fuel. It will be dark in a few hours and a heavy fog has 
  rolled in, so it seems like the safest time to venture out.</p>
  
  <p>She's already decided not to run the boat motor, not to use the fuel or risk the noise, and the tide is against her, so 
    it's going to take a long time to row to the mainland, even though it isn't far. She tosses a box, a bag, a backpack, and 
    a gas can into the boat and sets out.</p>
  
  <p>The sea is calm and everything's quiet, and in a few hundred feet she will have a supreme view of the island through the 
    fog and the setting sun. It was a landfill, built out of clear resin and useless electronics, built like a labyrinth for 
    tourists. Esther has been carving out the walls with an icepick for parts.</p>
  
  <p>She is almost finished.</p>
  
  <p>As the sunlight peeks through the island's translucent corridors and balconies and abandoned shops, Esther recalls the last
    trip to the mainland, and hastily suppresses the memory. She keeps rowing, tries to stay grounded, tries to remind herself
    that she does not really know what happened, that these are all theories.</p> 
  
  <p>But the idea won't stay down, and maybe if she lets it happen she won't think about bigger problems. It was a woman, in a 
    red dress, who had sewn rocks into the hem and walked into the sea. It had worked. She was the last person Esther had
    seen.</p>
  
  <p>She scans the fog for lights, any sign of life, and thinks about the last lights she saw. She thinks about before, and
    tries to piece together another plausible theory, anything that could explain... But there's really only one possibility
    that makes sense to her, and she doesn't like to think about that, so she keeps rowing.</p>
  
  <p>The moon should be nearly new, and after the sun sets it will be almost completely dark. She cannot afford to be out that
    late.</p>
  
  <p>The water is starting to get shallow and she could jump out here but she keeps rowing until the boat touches sand. She
    pulls it a bit further out of the water but the tide is high so she doesn't need to move it far.</p>
  
  <p>She steps into the water as quietly as possible, throws the pack, the bag, and the can into the box, and takes out a lantern
    but does not turn it on. She runs across the beach to a staircase and does not relax until she is under the cover of
    trees.</p>
  
  <p>There are a few blocks of suburbs between the beach and the main road, and she crosses them quickly. She turns a block 
    before the highway, staying under the trees, and reaches the gas station before the sun touches the horizon.</p>
  
  <p>She pries up a manhole with a crowbar, picks an interior lock, and takes out a long rubber tube. It takes most of the tube's
    length to reach liquid but she does manage to siphon most of a canful og gas. She adds it to the box and steps through the
    smashed glass doors of the convenience store.</p>
  
  <p>Some of the immediately visible canned foods are bloated with botulism, but she thinks she hears a sound and the back door
    appears to be locked, from a distance. She calculates the risk that someone saw her approach and hid from her, she doesn't
    want to meet someone's survival instinct again, so she quickly takes a few unspoiled comestibles and leaves.</p>
  
  <p>Piling it into the backpack, she realizes it's all dried meat and snack cakes, but there's a grocery store a little further 
    into town. Maybe there will be some copper wire left somewhere.</p>
  
  <p>She walks a block off the highway for tree cover, checks her shoulder holster, and carries the box and the gas can towards
    the grocery store.</p>
