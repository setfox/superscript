===DESIGN===
- needs professional-quality audio/image hosting
- pages are not randomized
- music is not randomized (separately from pages)
- randomization is not stored per user (to prevent page duplication)
- there are no audio controls (play/pause, volume up/down)
- i have not finished uploading pt1 (~8 pages)
- a nice smoky gradient would be an improvement over a blank background
- animated page transitions are not yet implemented

===CONTENT===
- this is the first draft of the very beginning of an ambitious project, and may not resemble the finished project.
- audio has been mastered for traditional release, and needs to be revised to loop properly.
