===DESIGN===
- needs professional-quality image hosting (play button)
- pages are not randomized
- music is not randomized (separately from pages)
- randomization is not stored per user (to prevent page duplication)
- there are no audio controls (play/pause, volume up/down)
- i have not finished uploading pt1 (~8 pages)
- a nice smoky gradient would be an improvement over a blank background
- animated page transitions are not yet implemented
- i do not yet own an acceptable custom domain name
- needs donate button - professional/domain hosting is probably $50-100/yr
- pages need menu button (separate pages: about project, about author, donate) 
-- make temp mockup: 3 links, no menu -- implement menu later
-- donate page could include merch sales 
--- i.e. unrewritable USB of full project, listed as "SOLD OUT" until content is finalized
- audio doesn't play on mobile
- mobile display offers "make page mobile-friendly" dialog which inverts the color palette, how do i prevent this?
- ideally the frontpage music should continue playing through the first page, then it switches for pg2
- audio needs to fade out when next is clicked
- circular audio play bar?


===CONTENT===
- this is the first draft of the very beginning of an ambitious project, and may not resemble the finished project.
- audio has been mastered for traditional release, and needs to be revised to loop properly.
