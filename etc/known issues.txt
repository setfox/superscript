===PRIORITY===
- randomization duplicates, and favors lower array elements
- make audio edits for looping
- there are no audio controls (play/pause, volume up/down)
- audio needs to fade out when next is clicked
- menu

===DESIGN===
- re-implement animated next button using javascript somehow
- needs professional-quality image hosting (play button)
- music is not randomized (separately from pages)
- ideally the frontpage music should continue playing through the first page, then it switches for pg2
- pages need menu button
- if the menu was a lightbox popup, it could replace the need for the frontpage music to continue to the first page
-- the same lightbox could be accessible from each page, so no need to return to the homepage
-- ~5 links on a bar at the top, which persists for each menu page
-- menu pages: about project, about author, page list, music list, donate/merch (USB/bandcamp link)
--- music & page lists should be editable checklists that indicate what has already been viewed or heard 
- a smoky gradient, possibly animated, would be an improvement over a blank background
- animated page transitions are not yet implemented
- the background gradient could visually overlap to white or gray, or to a cloud, or a loading animation, for page transitions
- i do not own an acceptable domain name
- audio doesn't play on mobile
- mobile display offers "make page mobile-friendly" dialog which inverts the color palette
- circular audio play bar

===CONTENT===
- this is the first draft of the very beginning of an ambitious project, and may not resemble the finished project.
- the part after aleph gets to the inner circle needs to maybe contain someone proving to her that they are not on earth by 
jumping into the air and offering to show her footage of how gravity was different on earth
- after aleph gets to the inner circle, after whoever links to the pedestrian that almost collides with sophia, that same person
has a conversation with someone else like "oh i had the strangest dream, i was trapped in a mobius strip labyrinth"
- this person should not be aleph, she should watch the procedure this time, for exposition's sake.
